# 3D Printer Enclosure System

## Overview

This project is a enclosure system designed for 3D printers. The system includes a web-based interface and an embedded controller using an ESP32 microcontroller running MicroPython. The goal of the enclosure system is to enhance the printing environment, providing better temperature control, safety features, and remote monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: Control and monitor your 3D printer enclosure remotely via a web browser.
  - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: A responsive and user-friendly interface to interact with the enclosure system.
  - **Real-time Monitoring**: View real-time data such as temperature, humidity, and enclosure status.
  
- **Embedded Controller**: An ESP32 microcontroller running MicroPython to interface with various sensors and actuators.
  - **Temperature**: Monitors and controls the internal environment.
